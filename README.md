# HBV_primer_fidelity
A rudimentary code to blast your HBV primers against 4,000+ full length HBV sequences, genotypes A-I, testing for pangenotypicity.
Sequences are pulled from http://hvdr.bioinf.wits.ac.za/alignments/. Please cite Bell et al. (10.1186/s40064-016-3312-0) if using this for publication.
